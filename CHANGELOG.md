2.9.5 - 2017-10-18
-----------------------------------------------

## Webpack
* Fixes `publicPath` with `extract-text-webpack-plugin`, so that fonts/images are referenced properly in production

2.9.4 - 2017-10-18
-----------------------------------------------

## Docker
* Adds [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) to `Dockerfile`, for Docker-compatible process management, clustering and auto-restart policing.
* Replaces start command with auto-clustering via PM2

2.9.3 - 2017-10-18
-----------------------------------------------

## Routing
* Adds app-wide `history` instance to `kit/lib/routing.js`, for controlling routes outside of React directly
* Replaces React Router's `<BrowserRouter>` with `<Router history={history}>`, to stay in sync with global pushstate

2.9.2 - 2017-10-17
-----------------------------------------------

## Server
* Setting `ctx.apollo.networkOptions` via a function passed to `config.addBeforeMiddleware()` will now get passed to the call to Apollo's `createNetworkInterface()` when using a third-party GraphQL server, enabling dynamic per-request CORS / authorisation logic, as needed

2.9.1 - 2017-10-17
-----------------------------------------------

## Config
* Adds `.addBeforeMiddleware()`, for adding Koa middleware that runs before Apollo/Redux instantiation
* Adds `.disableTiming()` to optionally remove the `Response-Time` header / timing middleware

## Server
* Renames `ctx.apollo` to `ctx.apollo.client`. Now, setting `ctx.apollo.options` in before middleware will merge those settings into Apollo client creation
* Adds logic to check for the presence of `ctx.apollo.client` and `ctx.store` before using default Apollo/Redux init. This allows overrides in before middleware for completely custom instantiation

2.8.0 - 2017-09-04
-----------------------------------------------

*Breaking changes*.

This release introduces some breaking changes to host environment vars, and SSL work:

**Host and port environment variables**

Until now, changing hosts/ports required setting environment-specific variables, such as `SERVER_DEV_HOST` or `BROWSER_PROD_PORT`. The number of combinations made this somewhat confusing; there's little point setting `SERVER_PROD_HOST` when ReactQL is built in development mode, for example.

In this release, we've simplified config to just:

- `HOST`
- `PORT`

... which sets both the server endpoints, as well as the default GraphQL URI -- in whichever environment you happen to be running in (i.e. `npm start` = dev, `npm run build-run` = production)

Additionally, you can set the following in 'hot code reload' Webpack browser mode:

- `BROWSER_HOST`
- `BROWSER_PORT`

... which will specifically override HOST and DEV for that mode.

**SSL**

v2.6.0 introduced SSL. This was implemented as sharing a SINGLE port for both HTTP + HTTPS, which works well for development - but less so for production, where ports 80 and 443 are more typical. The `tcpHandler()` function has been removed, and both servers now run on their own environment-defined ports.

In addition to the new environment variables above, you can set `SSL_PORT` in the environment which will mount the HTTPS server on the correct port. If you fail to pass this, the HTTPS server simply won't start, and options sent to `config.enableSSL()` will be ignored.

**`kit/lib/env.js`**

Since env vars have been simplified, most of the boilerplate in this file was rendered moot. This has now been refactored into an enhanced `getServerURL` function that automatically returns either 'http://' or 'https://' as the URL prefix, the correct host, along with a port number -- (unless the port is 80 or 443, in which case the port is omitted since it's implicit.)

## Kit
* Fixes #71 - setting `SERVER_DEV_HOST` and `SERVER_PROD_HOST` results in the correct GraphQL and app endpoints

## NPM
* Removes packages:
"get-port": "^3.2.0"

2.7.0 - 2017-09-01
-----------------------------------------------

## Config
* Now `config.addRoute()` (and derivatives) accept multiple route handlers

## NPM
* Bumps packages:
graphql                ^0.11.1  →  ^0.11.2
react-helmet            ^5.1.3  →   ^5.2.0
brotli-webpack-plugin   ^0.4.0  →   ^0.4.1
css-loader             ^0.28.5  →  ^0.28.7
iltorb                  ^1.3.5  →   ^1.3.6
image-webpack-loader    ^3.3.1  →   ^3.4.0
npm-run-all             ^4.1.0  →   ^4.1.1

2.6.0 - 2017-08-28
-----------------------------------------------

This release enables SSL with one line -- `config.enableSSL(options)`!

Now SSL and plain HTTP can live side-by-side, on the same port, thanks to a new `tcpHandler()` function that proxies data to the correct listening port, avoiding the need to expose more than one port publicly.

All changes:

## Config
* Adds `config.getKoaApp()`, for passing a function that access Koa's `app` instance, allowing you to do something with `app` that's not covered by other functions (closes https://github.com/reactql/kit/issues/65)
* Adds `config.enableSSL(opt)`, for running Koa via a HTTPS/SSL server
* Adds `config.disableHTTP()`, for disabling a plain HTTP server listener (used in conjunction with `config.enableSSL()`, when you want SSL-only)
* Adds `config.forceSSL(opts)`, for re-writing plain `http://` -> `https://` using [koa-sslify](https://github.com/turboMaCk/koa-sslify)

## Server
* Adds `http` and `https` configurations, for enabling SSL
* Adds `get-port`, for assigning http(s) listeners to random ports
* Adds `listen()` function, for proxying traffic to http(s) depending on the request received (if the first byte == 22 ? SSL : HTTP)
* Refactors `kit/entry/server.js` to no longer export an immediate `async` function (no longer returns a Promise)
* Refactors `kit/entry/server_*` to use the new `server.js` default export

## App
* Adds example use of `config.getKoaApp()`, that extends the `app.context` prototype with an `engine = 'ReactQL'` key, which we later use in middleware to add a 'Powered-By' response header. Also adds a general error catching function, for server-level errors.
* Adds `src/cert/self_signed.js`, to export a sample self-signed SSL certificate to enable SSL in userland
* Adds `config.enableSSL()` example, for running HTTPS side-by-side with the regular HTTP port
* Adds commentary for new `config.disableHTTP()` and `config.forceSSL()` functions

## NPM
* Adds packages:
"get-port": "^3.2.0"
"koa-sslify": "^2.1.2"

* Bumps packages:
graphql                 ^0.10.5  →  ^0.11.1
apollo-server-koa   ^1.1.0  →   ^1.1.2
react-apollo       ^1.4.14  →  ^1.4.15
react-router        ^4.1.2  →   ^4.2.0
react-router-dom    ^4.1.2  →   ^4.2.2
npm-run-all         ^4.0.2  →   ^4.1.0

2.5.3 - 2017-08-26
-----------------------------------------------

## Config
* Adds `config.setApolloNetworkOptions()`, for passing `opts` to Apollo's `createNetworkInterface`
* Renames `config.setApolloOptions()` -> `config.setApolloClientOptions()`, to differentiate with `config.setApolloNetworkOptions()`
* Adds server-side `config.setCORSOptions()`, for setting CORS config options for `koa-cors`

2.5.2 - 2017-08-26
-----------------------------------------------

## Config
* Adds `config.setApolloOptions()`, for passing in an object of Apollo Client instantiation options

## Server
* Refactors `createLocalInterface` to accept Koa's context object when using local GraphQL schema via `apollo-local-query`

2.5.1 - 2017-08-22
-----------------------------------------------

## Config
* Adds `setErrorHandler()` function, to enable custom error logging/middleware

## App
* Adds example that uses a custom error handler
* Fires sample `INCREMENT_COUNTER` action in server middleware, to demonstrate sending `count: 1` down the wire via SSR

## NPM
* Bumps packages:
babel-loader         ^7.1.1  →  ^7.1.2
eslint               ^4.4.1  →  ^4.5.0
eslint-plugin-react  ^7.2.1  →  ^7.3.0
webpack-config       ^7.2.1  →  ^7.4.0

2.5.0 - 2017-08-21
-----------------------------------------------

## Redux
* **Breaking change** - reducers should no longer be registered as `{ state, reducer}`. Instead, the format is:

```js
// root key name, reducer function, and initial state (as a plain object)
config.addReducer('keyName', reducerFunction, { count: 0 });
```

* Initial state should now be a plain object; it will be wrapped in a call to `seamless-immutable` automatically, providing immutability by default

* Refactors `kit/lib/redux.js -> unwind()` to wrap custom reducers in a `defaultReducer` function, that detects a Redux undefined sentinel `state` and returns a plain object -- otherwise, calls the 'real'  reducer. (The side-effect to this is that reducer no longer need to handle undefined values!)

## GraphQL
* Adds optional middleware / afterware to Apollo client instantiation via:
- `config.addApolloMiddleware()`
- `config.addApolloAfterware()`
Both functions can be called isomorphically; the middleware will be attached only to the environment in which it's called, so wrap in an `if (SERVER)...` block if you need to isolate this behaviour. Note: If you're using a built-in GraphQL server, ReactQL will use  [apollo-local-query](https://github.com/af/apollo-local-query) instead of regular HTTP requests so middleware won't be executed -- be aware of this if you're doing HTTP header authentication!

## Config
* Refactors the `Config` class to progressively add server-side config functions by moving the class into sub-classes for the browser/server

2.4.0 - 2017-08-18
-----------------------------------------------

## Server
* Moves Apollo client and Redux store to Koa `ctx` middleware, so it's available to all routes
* Adds `config.addMiddleware()`, to add custom middleware to the Koa server

## App
* Adds sample `Powered-By` header, to showcase custom middleware
* Adds `ctx.store.getStore()` dump to sample `/test` and 404 routes, to show the difference in Apollo response

2.3.0 - 2017-08-17
-----------------------------------------------

## GraphQL
* Adds GraphiQL IDE by default to `/graphql` when using external GraphQL endpoint
* Allows explicit GraphiQL IDE endpoint to be set on `config.enableGraphQLServer|setGraphQLEndpoint()`
* Updates GraphiQL endpoint to match internal GraphQL POST endpoint URL by default (falls back to `/graphql`)

## Config
* **Breaking change** -- now `config.enableGraphQLServer()` should be called isomorphically!
* Adds explicit `config.setGraphQLSchema()` for passing the schema to the GraphQL server (use inside a `SERVER` block only!)

2.2.0 - 2017-08-17

-----------------------------------------------

# New features in 2.0.0

Kit v2 introduces a few significant improvements that make it easier to upgrade between kits, and power-up your ReactQL experience:

## React v16 + new streaming SSR

React has been bumped to the new v16, and `renderToString` has been replaced with `renderToStream` -- for turbo-powered first page rendering of React to HTML.

Early tests have shown a promising reduction from 12ms+ for React-only rendering (no GraphQL) to 4-5ms on my local Macbook Pro, using out-the-box defaults.

What's more, on Node 8+, the asynchronous `createReactHandler` that sets up the Redux store, runs Helmet, initialises the component tree and starts the stream, has been benchmarked as low as 0.48ms on my same machine!

Your ReactQL project will be faster than ever.

## Kit API - a cleaner separation between 'kit' and 'app' code

In kit v1.x, the lines between ReactQL and your client code were a little blurry.  Editing the Apollo endpoint meant modifying `config/project.js`, which was a file that Webpack also used to assess whether to show the bundle optimiser post-build.

If you wanted to add anything more to the server or browser, you'd typically need to delve into `kit/*` files and make changes.

Now, the separation between two is clearer than ever. ReactQL v2.x introduces a new `Config` singleton instance that provides 'hooks' into adding functionality to the standard config, without mashing together custom code.

ReactQL is and always has been a 'starter kit', and will continue to be so. But now the framework-esque separation of client and kit code paves the way to clean abstractions, and easier upgrading.

In a future ReactQL CLI version, it's possible that you'll be able to upgrade an active project to the latest kit with a single command, instead of the current process of creating a new project, copying over `src` and manually/surgically editing kit files.

## Built-in GraphQL server.

ReactQL was originally focused on being a front-end starter kit.  But the effort put into creating a fast and capable SSR stack means you now also have an ideal home to run a monolithic GraphQL server, too.

Starting with 2.0, you're now able to add a GraphQL server easily, by add a few lines of code to `src/app.js`:

**src/app.js**
```js
// Import the new `Config` singleton instance
import config from `kit/config`;

// Enable GraphQL on the server -- this code will be eliminated from the browser bundle
if (SERVER) {
  config.enableGraphQLServer(require('src/path/to/schema').default);
}
```

That's it!

The above mounts a GraphQL server inside Koa at `/graphql`, gives you a visual UI to query data via GraphiQL, and sets up Apollo to point to the server URI automatically. It takes care of your server-side CORS config, and adds POST body processing for incoming GraphQL queries.

It also adds [apollo-local-query](https://github.com/af/apollo-local-query) to Apollo client initialisation on the server, so instead of routing requests over the network, GraphQL queries are made against the schema already loaded in memory -- eliminating TCP/IP overhead.

Of course, if you want to connect to a third-party endpoint, you can still do that easily:

```js
config.setApolloURI('http://example.com/graphql');
```

(Special thanks to graph.cool for allowing us to use their service in the starter kit in 1.x. Hopefully the move above will also take some load off your server :smile:)

## Add Redux reducers more easily

With the new `Config` API, you no longer need to edit `kit/lib/redux.js` to add custom reducers.

Instead, you can add them to `src/app.js` and keep reducers in userland:

```js
import config from `kit/config`;

// Create a reducer somewhere, shaped as { state, reducer() } -- this will
// probably be imported from a separate file
const someReducer = {
  // This is the reducer's initial state
  state: {
    someSetting: true,
  },
  reducer(state, action) {
    // ... reducer code to do something with `state`
  }
}

// Add the reducer, and specify the reducer key
settings.addReducer('someKey', someReducer);
```

## Custom routes

You can now add custom GET|POST|PUT|PATCH routes to the server, like so:

```js
// We can add custom routes to the web server easily, by using
// `config.add<Get|Post|Put|Patch>Route()`.  Note:  These are server routes only.
config.addGetRoute('/test', async ctx => {
  ctx.body = 'Hello from your ReactQL route.';
});
```

Routes will be added in insertion order, to obey your precedence rules.

## POST body parsing

`koa-bodyparser` is enabled by default, to process POST requests for a built-in GraphQL server or custom POST routes.

By default, it'll process JSON and form requests automatically.

You can disable with:

```js
config.disableBodyParser();
```

Or pass in your own custom options to `koa-bodyparser` with:

```js
config.setBodyParserOptions({
  // Example of a config option -- see https://github.com/koajs/bodyparser
  jsonLimit: '8mb',
})
```

## Custom 404 handler

The custom 404 handler added in 2.0 is one of several planned API 'hooks' that allow you to attach custom functionality to common server and browser entry points, without editing kit code.

This example ships in the starter kit:

```js
config.set404Handler((ctx, store) => {
  // For demo purposes, let's get a JSON dump of the current Redux state
  // to see that we can expect its contents
  const stateDump = JSON.stringify(store.getState());

  // Explicitly set the return status to 404.  This is done for us by
  // default if we don't have a custom 404 handler, but left to the function
  // otherwise (since we might not always want to return a 404)
  ctx.status = 404;

  // Set the body
  ctx.body = `This route does not exist on the server - Redux dump: ${stateDump}`;
});
```

You get access to the Koa `ctx` request context object as well as the Redux `store`, giving you the flexibility to handle responses in whichever way makes the most sense for your application.

In future kits, expect hooks to crop up in places like redirect and error handling.

## Neater `src` layout; more commentary

The out-the-box sample app that comes with a new ReactQL project is now better organised. Instead of a single `src/app.js` file, components have been given their own files/folders, and tons of extra commentary has been added to give you a better idea of what's happening under the hood.

Whilst `src/app.js` is still required in every project (that's where ReactQL will look for your app code), now the file should serve two simple purposes:

1. Configuring the app, per the new features above.
2. Exporting the root React component, to mount automatically inside `<Html> -> <div id="main"/>`

This best practice will make it easier to organise your code, and know what goes where.

Several components also demonstrate the pattern of asset co-location; images and SASS code is often in the same directory as the calling `.js` file, to make it clear which assets belong to which React components.

---

v2.0 documentation will land on https://reactql.org/docs soon.

All changes:

## Code layout
* Removes moot `config/project.js`

## Configuration
* Adds new `Config` class to `kit/config.js`, initialised as a singleton to use globally in `src/app.js`
* Adds the following new methods:
- `addReducer(key, reducer)` -- adds a new Redux reducer in the shape of `{state, reducer()}`
- `disableBodyParser()` -- disables `koa-bodyparser` in the server config
- `setBodyParserOptions(opt)` -- pass custom `koa-bodyparser` options to override defaults
- `addRoute(method, route, handler)` -- add new Koa route
- `addGetRoute(route, handler)` -- add new GET route
- `addPostRoute(route, handler)` -- add new POST route
- `addPutRoute(route, handler)` -- add new PUT route
- `addPatchRoute(route, handler)` -- add new PATCH route
- `addDeleteRoute(route, handler)` -- add new DELETE route
- `set404Handler(func)` -- sets a custom 404 handler, which is given `(state, store)` inside `createReactHandler()`
- `enableGraphQLServer(schema, endpoint = '/graphql', graphiql = true)` -- enables built-in GraphQL web server at `/graphql`, (optionally) enables up GraphiQL
- `setGraphQLEndpoint(uri)` -- sets the GraphQL server URI for Apollo. For use with external GraphQL servers.

## Browser
* Replaces ReactDOM's deprecated `render` with the new `hydrate` method, for rehydrating server HTML.

## Server
* Bumps to React v16's streaming API.
* React's `data-reactid` tags no longer appear in resulting HTML, saving bandwidth
* Adds GraphQL server configuration
* Adds GraphiQL UI option when using a local GraphQL server
* Adds `apollo-local-query`, for bypassing the network when using a local GraphQL server
* Adds `createNeworkInterface()`, for memoizing network interface creation on the server
* Refactors React to use `renderToStream` instead of `renderToStaticMarkup`
* Refactors `<Html>` component to take component tree as a child prop, and not as a rendered string
* Adds custom route configuration
* Adds `kcors` to allow cross-origin requests by default (for REST/GraphQL)

## Libs
* Removes `serverClient()` method in `kit/lib/apollo.js`, to avoid unnecessary `apollo-local-query` bundling on the browser
* Improves `getURL()` in `kit/lib/env.js`, to allow a boolean flag to enable HTTPS
* Adds `getServerURL()` to `kit/lib/env.js`, to explicitly get the web server host and port (typically for GraphQL)
* Refactors `kib/lib/redux.js` to derive config from the `config.reducers` Map

## Webpack
* Adds new `npm run build-analyze` option, to open a browser window showing the bundle analysis report after building
* Removes explicit `BUNDLE_ANALYZER` config option -- now uses the above command

## App
* Refactors app code to tidy up the `src` folder
* Gives each component its own file/folder layout, with images/CSS co-located
* Adds tons of extra commentary to make it clearer how each component works
* Moves `<root>/reducers` to `src/reducers`, to reflect best practices
* Refactors counter reducer to use the new `{state, reducer()}` reducer shape (now exported bare; no longer attached to a reducer key)
* Refactors SASS/CSS to use separate files to be imported by components, instead of together in one file

## Helpers
* Adds `kit/lib/console.js` and `logServerStarted()` function, for dumping neat console messages to the screen when starting servers
* Adds `kit/lib/routing.js`, with `<Status>` (internal), `<NotFound>` and `<Redirect>` components for handling status codes, 404s and redirects, universally.

## Webpack / bundling
* Adds ability to use multiple webpack-configs in a given config file, by exporting as an array
* Tidies up `kit/webpack/base` with common stats; fixes path typo
* Adds `kit/webpack/dev.js`, which is extended by server_dev and browser_dev and adds the correct env vars and source-maps.
* Closes #22 - Adds static bundling.  Now you can run `npm run build-static` to create a production browser bundle along with an `index.html` file, for uploading to a static web host
* Adds `npm run build-static-run`, for static bundling and running the static site locally on port 5000
* Adds `npm run static`, for running an already built static bundle
* Refactors `kit/webpack/browser_prod.js` to add console messages; fixes minor chunk hash typo

  "static": Starts a static web server on port 5000 for a previously built static bundle
  "test": Currently does nothing. TBD.

## App
* Adds 404 route handling (currently a blank response - but 404 codes can be implemented at the server level to be handled by middleware, or respond appropriately; redirects TBD.)

1.2.0 - 2017-05-22

1.0.7 - 2017-04-17
------------------------------------------------
* Optimises `window.*` initial variables on SSR by removing whitespace
* Allows passing a `window` prop to `<Html>` on SSR, instead of separate props for `webpackManifest` / `state`

1.0.6 - 2017-04-17
------------------------------------------------
* Moves `manifest.json` and `chunk-manifest.json` to `dist` instead of `dist/public` (stops them being accessible publicly)
* Fixes issue with manifest paths not working on non-root routes

1.0.5 - 2017-04-17
------------------------------------------------
* Closes #1 - Adds `/favicon.ico` route handling-- if an icon is available, it'll be served. Otherwise, the server will return "204 No Content"
* Adds sample ReactQL favicon at `static/favicon.ico`
* Moved `static/webpack.html` default page for the Webpack Dev Server to `kit/views/webpack.html`, to emphasise that `static` is userland
* Improves Webpack Dev Server config to check `static/*` first, and then `kit/views/*` when looking for static files (i.e. the `webpack.html` default view)
* Adds `CopyWebpackPlugin` to production-- `static/*` will be copied to `dist/public/*` to make static files available to the production server

1.0.4 - 2017-04-17
------------------------------------------------
* Adds decorator syntax via [transform-decorators-legacy](https://github.com/loganfsmyth/babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy)

* Adds support for extending `React.PureComponent` without generating linting errors (when using props/context)
* Modifies sample `<GraphQLMessage>` component in `src/app.js` to use `@graphql` as a decorator and static `propTypes`

------------------------------------------------
* Merges #8 - removes deprecation warning related to loaderUtils.parseQuery()

1.0.2 - 2017-04-17
------------------------------------------------
